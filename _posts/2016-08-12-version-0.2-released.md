I'm very happy to announce today the availability of **Intecture 0.2**.

# What's in this update?

1. A new authentication mechanism has been added, providing mutual Curve certificate authentication for users and hosts. This is powered by [ZeroMQ's Curve authentication](http://curvezmq.org).
2. Binary packages have appeared in 0.2.1, thanks to a new project called [RustBucket](https://rust-bucket.io). This means that installing Intecture no longer requires Rust to be installed.
3. A number of support libraries have been spun off from the Intecture codebase, including the file upload components, which now live in a library called [ZFileXfer](https://github.com/betweenlines/zfilexfer) (name under development!).

# What's in the next update?

*The quest for stability...*

- Currently there is a communication issue with Intecture components across server boundaries. This needs to be remedied.
- Sadly the FFI update didn't make it into this release. The FFI requires patching in order to make it memory safe. Also we need to remove `.unwrap()` calls so we can handle error cases like civilised folk.
- Lots of work needs to be done to improve project governance, which will pave the way to building an open source community around Intecture.

Stay tuned! You ain't seen nothing yet :-)

Cheers,
